      * **Image Overlays:** Annotated images for presentation

**Phase 4: Clinical Integration**
   1. **Review with Clinical Context**
      
      * Compare with patient history and symptoms
      * Correlate with previous imaging studies
      * Consider clinical differential diagnosis

   2. **Quality Assurance**
      
      * Verify AI findings against clinical expertise
      * Flag any discrepancies for further review
      * Document final clinical impressions

Tips for Optimal Results
------------------------

**Image Quality Guidelines:**
   * Use high-resolution images (minimum 1024x1024 pixels)
   * Ensure proper contrast and brightness
   * Avoid heavily compressed JPEG files
   * Check for artifacts or patient motion blur

**Model Selection Strategy:**
   * Start with VinBigData-Standard for general screening
   * Use Enhanced models for subtle abnormalities
   * Apply fracture-specific models when trauma is suspected
   * Consider custom models for specialized populations

**Interpretation Best Practices:**
   * Always review AI findings in clinical context
   * Use confidence scores as guidance, not absolute truth
   * Correlate findings with patient presentation
   * Consult the AI assistant for unclear results

**Common Troubleshooting:**
   * **Slow Processing:** Check available RAM and close other applications
   * **Model Loading Errors:** Verify internet connection for downloads
   * **Image Import Issues:** Ensure DICOM files are not corrupted
   * **Unexpected Results:** Verify image orientation and patient positioning
