Understanding AI Results
------------------------

**Confidence Scores Interpretation**

Confidence scores represent the AI model's certainty about each finding:

* **90-100%:** Very High Confidence - Strong evidence of pathology
* **70-89%:** High Confidence - Likely pathology present
* **50-69%:** Moderate Confidence - Possible pathology, review recommended
* **30-49%:** Low Confidence - Uncertain finding, clinical correlation needed
* **Below 30%:** Very Low Confidence - Likely false positive

**Clinical Correlation Guidelines**

   **High Confidence Findings (>70%):**
      * Generally reliable for screening purposes
      * Consider clinical context and patient history
      * May warrant immediate clinical attention
   
   **Moderate Confidence Findings (50-70%):**
      * Require careful clinical evaluation
      * Consider additional imaging or follow-up
      * Correlate with patient symptoms
   
   **Low Confidence Findings (<50%):**
      * Often represent borderline or subtle changes
      * May indicate early pathology or normal variants
      * Clinical judgment crucial for interpretation

**Bounding Box Annotations**

Visual annotations help locate and understand findings:

* **Red Boxes:** High-priority findings (pneumothorax, mass)
* **Orange Boxes:** Moderate-priority findings (consolidation, effusion)
* **Yellow Boxes:** Low-priority findings (minor atelectasis, scarring)
* **Size Indication:** Larger boxes for extensive abnormalities
